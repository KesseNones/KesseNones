# Greetings! 

# About

I am Jesse (any/all), a computer science degree holder looking to contribute to the world and find an eventual career in *something*. I enjoy programming languages and systems programming concepts but have also dabbled in most other fields of computer science in my education, excepting maybe machine learning stuff but I could learn that too. Overall, I specialize in programming language design at present before having made a career. When not coding a play video games and write/learn about sci-fi lore.

# Fun Fact: I made two whole programming languages just because I can!
